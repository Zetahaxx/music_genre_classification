# music_genre_classification
This project contains prediction of music genre through different classification algorithm  like decision tree, random forest and xgboost and optimized using hyperparameter tuning .
The performance metrics of each algorithm is compared and analysed. Moreover we have also compared the before and after performance of hyperparameter tuning.
RandomSearchCV is used as tuning approach and we have even done cross validation with 5 folds where each fold contains 100 candidates for experimental design.
MLFlow is used for tracking the experiment and finding the best parameter.
